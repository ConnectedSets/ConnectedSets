  /* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Joins are a major feature of relational databases, and a consequence of
      normalization.
      
      Most charded, and so-called NoSQL, databases try to avoid joins favoring
      denormalized schemas. The idea of building applications with no joins at
      all is very attractive and provides for simplified programming while
      greatly simplifying charded database implementations.
      
      However, many applications cannot be practically designed with no joins
      at all, and in some cases, the resulting duplication of data can become
      detrimental to desirable network performance especially over the
      internet between a mobile client and a server.
      
      For these reasons, Toubkal comes with a full set of inner, left, right
      and full outer joins that can be used both server-side for complex
      applications, and client-side to optimize network performance and data
      caching or simply out of design and productivity considerations.
      
      Toubkal joins are incrementally updated for maximum performances on
      updates.

      @pipelet join( b, on, merge, options )
      
      @short Joins source and ```b``` sets ```on``` condition, using ```merge()```
      
      @parameters
      - b              (Pipelet): dataflow to join with ```a``` (source dataflow)
      
      - on (Array of conditions): define which values of ```a``` should be merged with values of ```b```.
                                  See conditions definition bellow.
      
      - merge         (Function): function( a_value, b_value ), called to merge matching values
                                  from ```a``` and ```b```. See below for important details.
      
      - options: (Object):
        - key (Array of Strings): the list of attributes of merged values that define unique output
                                  values, defaults to ```a``` key.
        
        - left         (Boolean): all values from ```a``` will produce at least one merged value even if
                                  there are no matching value in ```b```. Defaults to false.
        
        - right        (Boolean): all values from ```b``` will produce at least one merged value even if
                                  there are no matching value in ```a```. Defaults to false.
        
        - outer        (Boolean): means full outer join, simulataneously "right" and "left" join,
                                  this is a shortcut for "left" and "right" set to true. Defaults
                                  to false.
        
        - no_filter (Boolean): when true, prevents join() from filtering
          ```a``` with ```b```. Defaults to false which means that if possible
          join() will filter ```a``` with ```b``` in order to reduce the
          amount of data subscribed from ```a```. Filtering is done only if
          the join is either an inner or right join, i.e. no filtering is
          done if the this is a left or full outer join.
        
        - untag (String): optional, to untag concurent transactions
          between ```a``` and ```b``` dataflows.
        
        - concurrent (Object): if ```a``` and ```b``` are @@concurrent,
          their @@tag MUST be specified using this option, e.g.:
          
          ```javascript
            a.join( b, [ 'id' ] { concurrent: { tag_name: true } };
          ```
      
      @examples
      
      - 1. Add employee's first name and last name to all sales from the "sales" dataflow for which
        employee id is found in the "employees" dataflow.
        
        ```javascript
          sales.join( employees, [ [ 'employee_id', 'id' ] ], function( sale, employee ) {
          
            if ( employee ) { // may be undefined because this is a left join
              return employee ? extend( {
                employee_first_name: employee.first_name,
                employee_last_name : employee.last_name
              }, sale ) : sale;
            }
            
            return sale;
            
          }, { key: [ 'id' ], left: true } )
        ```
        
        The unique key is comprised only of the sales "id" because output values are still sales.
      
      - 2. For employees of the "employees" dataflow which have sales, output sales with employee
        first and last name.
        
        ```javascript
          sales.join( employees, [ [ 'employee_id', 'id' ] ], function( sale, employee ) {
          
            return extend( {
              employee_first_name: employee.first_name,
              employee_last_name : employee.last_name
            }, sale );
            
          }, { key: [ 'id' ] )
        ```
        
        The main difference in the definition of this join with the previous example, is that this
        is an inner join (options left is not defined). Therefore "employee" of the merge function
        is always defined and does not need to be tested.
        
        The performance profile of this join is also significantly different than in the previous
        example as sales are subscribed-to only for existing employees reducing the amount of data
        pulled from the "sales" dataflow.
      
      - 3. For all sales and all employees, output sales with employees' first and last name when
        available or employees with no sales:
        
        ```javascript
          sales.join( employees, [ [ 'employee_id', 'id' ] ], function( sale, employee ) {
          
            if ( employee ) { // may be undefined because this is a left join
              return extend( {
                employee_first_name: employee.first_name,
                employee_last_name : employee.last_name
              }, sale );
            }
            
            return sale;
            
          }, { key: [ 'id', 'employee_id' ], outer: true )
        ```
        
        This is now an outer join, employees are not (and cannot be) used to filter sales.
        
        Key attributes now include "employee_id" to garanty unicity of the join output values
        for employees with no sales.
        
        In the merge function:
        - Employee's presence must be tested.
        
        - Sale's presence does not need to be tested because extend() allows undefined parameters,
          and sale id can be undefined since the output of join() can emit at most one non-matching
          output value per input value.
        
      - 4. For all employees, get sales, or no sales:
        
        ```javascript
          sales.join( employees, [ [ 'employee_id', 'id' ] ], function( sale, employee ) {
          
            if ( employee ) { // may be undefined because this is a left join
              return extend( {
                employee_first_name: employee.first_name,
                employee_last_name : employee.last_name
              }, sale );
            }
            
            return sale;
            
          }, { key: [ 'id', 'employee_id' ], right: true )
        ```
        
        This is a right join, filtering sales by existing employees.
        
        Key attributes include "employee_id" to garanty unicity of the join output values
        for employees with no sales.
      
      @description
      
      Joins ```a``` (source) and ```b``` dataflows using merge() much like SQL joins
      would merge records from two tables.
      
      The type of join is defined in options, default is an inner join.
      
      ### On conditions
      
      The ```on``` condition is an Array of and-conditions, i.e. all conditions must be met for the
      on condition to succeed. Each condition applies to individual attributes of the source set
      or the 'b' set. A condition can be specified as:
      - A string representing the name of an attribute present in both 'a' and 'b'. The
        condition matches for all values for which the attribute name has the same value in
        'a' and 'b'.
        
      - An Array of two attribute names, where the first element is an attribute name in 'a'
        and the second an attribute name in 'b'. The condition matches for values where there
        the values of these respective attributes in 'a' and 'b' are equal.
      
      ### Merge function
      
      The merge() function is called when there is a match on the join condition or no match for
      outer joins requiring values from ```a```, ```b```, or ```a``` and ```b``` to be merged into output values.
      
      The signature of merge() is:
      
      ```javascript
        ( Object a_value, Object b_value ) -> Object merged_value
      ```
      
      Where:
      - a_value is an Object from ```a```
      - b_value is an Object from ```b```
      
      Merged values returned by merge() must have a unique key to allow remove and update
      operations or when the join is a left, right or full outer join. The only case where merged
      values do not require a unique key is on inner joins where both ```a``` and ```b``` never remove
      values.
      
      !!! Warning: merge() should not mutate a_value or b_value. Mutating a_value or b_value
      will produce side-effects that would most likely cause incorrect future results.
      
      The function merge() must be purely functional, i.e. given the same parameter values it
      should always return the same value.
      
      On an inner join (options left, right, and outer are falsy), both a_value and b_value will
      always be defined, and merge() will be called at least once for each unique tupple in ```a```
      and ```b``` as defined by conditions.
      
      On a left join, b_value may be undefined if there is no match in ```b``` for a value of ```a```.
      
      On a right join, a_value may be undefined if there is no match in ```a``` for a value of ```b```.
      
      On outer joins a_value or b_value maybe undefined but at least one of them will be defined.
      
      When a_value or b_value is undefined, merge() returned values must remain consistent with the
      output schema of the join, i.e. values should have the same unique key as when both a_value
      and b_value are defined. However an attribute of that key may be null or undefined as long as
      this does not break the uniqueness of output values defined by key attributes.
      
      ### Memory usage
      
      Join is stateless on its output and stateful on its inputs meaning it does not need any
      cache on its inputs.
      
      An output cache is usually not necessary unless downstream dataflow graph is updated at a
      high rate requiring many fetch() operations which will run a bulk join from ```a``` and ```b```.
      
      ### Performance profile
      
      Semantically speaking, ```a``` and ```b``` along with corresponding
      left and right options and ```merge()``` parameters' order, can be
      swapped, i.e. join() can be considered commutative, semantically.
      
      However, swapping has a significantly different performance profile
      because:
      - ```b``` WILL BE used as a filter of ```a``` when this is not a left
        join and unless option no_filter is true
      - ```a``` IS NEVER used as a filter of ```b```
      
      This ```b``` filter does more than in-place filtering, it is also a
      dynamic query that subscribe to a subset of the ```a``` dataflow.
      
      Therefore when ```a``` is filtered by ```b```, while ```a``` holds a
      much larger dataset than ```b```, the amount of data subscribed from
      ```a``` may be significantly reduced, improving both latency,
      cpu-usage, and if ```a``` is accessed over a network, bandwidth
      usage.
      
      Converselly, if ```b``` is a larger dataset than ```a``` performances
      may be lower than if ```b``` is not used as a filter.
      
      Rules of thumb:
      - Just as with pipelet filter(), where the source dataflow is filtered
        using a datafow as first parameter, the source dataflow of join(),
        may be filtered only by its first parameter.
        
      - In order to optimally benefit from automatic subscription filters,
        one should usually use the larger dataset as a source of the join
        (the ```a``` dataflow) and the smaller dataset as a filter
        parameter (the ```b``` dataflow) of the join.
      
      - If a dataflow graph already filters the ```a``` dataflow or when
        automatic filtering is undesired for any reason, use option
        ```"no_filter"``` to disable filtering.
      
      ### Implementation
      
      To simplify the implementation we split the join between two sets into
      two half-joins. Each half join maintains an ordered representation of
      one of the sets which is used as a filter to the other set.
      Pipelet union() is then used to merge the two half-joins into the
      joined output.
